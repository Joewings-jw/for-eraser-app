### -> Platform Overview
- Description of the chatbot platform
- Primary goals and key features + 
- Types of inputs handled: Text, Voice, Image
### -> System Architecture
- High-level architecture diagram  [ï»¿Overview](https://app.eraser.io/workspace/mz92IWrPY7HVxI6tE26d?elements=if2d65Jte2yF0ZLqQvpQOQ) 
- Description of each component
### -> User Onboarding Process
- **User Registration:**
    1. **Sign-Up:**
        - Users sign up on the platform using a secure authentication mechanism like OAuth 2.0 or JWT.
    2. **Chatbot Creation:**
        - Upload an icon to help generate the theme of the chatbot.
        - Upload training data from various sources (website crawl, file upload, text input on the editor's platform, etc.).
    3. **Training:**
        - The platform processes the training data to train the chatbot using LLMs and RAG technology.
    4. **Creation:**
        - Users click 'create chatbot' to finalise the setup.
### **->Testing Phase and Deployment:**
1. **Internal Testing:**
- Newly created chatbots enter a test mode that simulates a production environment.
- Users can invite up to 5 people for internal testing.
- The chatbot must pass predefined metrics (accuracy, response time, user satisfaction) to proceed.
**   2. Deployment:**

- **Production Deployment:**
    - Upon passing tests, the chatbot is deployed to production.
    - Integration with platforms like Messenger, Slack, etc., via selectable dropdowns.
- **Dashboard:**
    - Users access a dashboard providing insights and analytics about their chatbots.
### -> Infrastructure Requirements
1. **Hosting: Authentication: Email: File Storage: Issue Tracking: Communication: API Keys: Feedback:**
    1. **Cloud Platform:** Azure for scalability, reliability, and extensive AI services.
    2. **Compute Services:** Azure App Service or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for hosting backend services and microservices.
2. **Logging:**

            - Package application (e.g., Docker images for AKS, zip for App Service).
            - Publish build artifacts.
    3. **Continuous Deployment (CD):**
        - **Trigger:** Successful CI build.
        - **Pipeline Steps:**
            - Deploy to development environment.
            - Run integration tests.
            - Approval gate for staging deployment.
            - Deploy to staging environment.
            - Run smoke tests.
            - Approval gate for production deployment.
            - Deploy to production environment using deployment slots or blue-green deployment strategy.
### -> Backend API Services
1. **Micro-service Architecture:**
    1. **Back-end API:**
        1. Restful APIs built with .NET Core or Node.js.
        2. Hosted on Azure App Service or AKS.
    2. **Bot Service:**
        1. Leveraging Microsoft Bot Framework, Azure AI, and Azure Bot Service.
        2. Integration with LLMs and RAG for advanced chatbot functionalities.
2. **Database Integration:**
    1. **Vector Databases:** Azure Cognitive Search.
    2. **Document Databases:** Azure Cosmos DB.
3. **LLMs and RAG Integration:**
