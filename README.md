- **Description of each component**

## User Onboarding Process
- **User Registration:**
  1. **Sign-Up:**
     - Users sign up on the platform using a secure authentication mechanism like OAuth 2.0 or JWT.
  2. **Chatbot Creation:**
     - Upload an icon to help generate the theme of the chatbot.
     - Upload training data from various sources (website crawl, file upload, text input on the editor's platform, etc.).
  3. **Training:**
     - The platform processes the training data to train the chatbot using LLMs and RAG technology.
  4. **Creation:**
     - Users click 'create chatbot' to finalize the setup.

## Testing Phase and Deployment
1. **Internal Testing:**
   - Newly created chatbots enter a test mode that simulates a production environment.
   - Users can invite up to 5 people for internal testing.
   - The chatbot must pass predefined metrics (accuracy, response time, user satisfaction) to proceed.
2. **Deployment:**
   - **Production Deployment:**
     - Upon passing tests, the chatbot is deployed to production.
     - Integration with platforms like Messenger, Slack, etc., via selectable dropdowns.
   - **Dashboard:**
     - Users access a dashboard providing insights and analytics about their chatbots.

## Infrastructure Requirements
1. **Hosting:**
   - **Cloud Platform:** Azure for scalability, reliability, and extensive AI services.
   - **Compute Services:** Azure App Service or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for hosting backend services and microservices.
2. **Logging:**
   - **Centralized Logging:** Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics for tracking platform and chatbot activities.
3. **Database:**
   - **Vector Databases:** Azure Cognitive Search for managing large datasets and efficient querying.
   - **Document Databases:** Azure Cosmos DB for flexible and scalable data storage.
4. **Payment Processing:**
   - **Payment Gateways:** Integration with Azure Payment HSM for secure and reliable payment processing.
5. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - **Code Repository:**
     - GitHub or Azure Repos.
   - **Continuous Integration (CI):**
     - **Trigger:** Code push or pull request.
     - **Pipeline Steps:**
       - Checkout code.
       - Install dependencies.
       - Build application.
       - Run unit tests (using NUnit/xUnit for .NET or Jest/Mocha for Node.js).
       - Package application (e.g., Docker images for AKS, zip for App Service).
       - Publish build artifacts.
   - **Continuous Deployment (CD):**
     - **Trigger:** Successful CI build.
     - **Pipeline Steps:**
       - Deploy to development environment.
       - Run integration tests.
       - Approval gate for staging deployment.
       - Deploy to staging environment.
       - Run smoke tests.
       - Approval gate for production deployment.
       - Deploy to production environment using deployment slots or blue-green deployment strategy.

## Backend API Services
1. **Microservice Architecture:**
   - **Backend API:**
     - Restful APIs built with .NET Core or Node.js.
     - Hosted on Azure App Service or AKS.
   - **Bot Service:**
     - Leveraging Microsoft Bot Framework, Azure AI, and Azure Bot Service.
     - Integration with LLMs and RAG for advanced chatbot functionalities.
2. **Database Integration:**
   - **Vector Databases:** Azure Cognitive Search.
   - **Document Databases:** Azure Cosmos DB.
3. **LLMs and RAG Integration:**
   - **Advanced AI Capabilities:**
     - Utilize Azure OpenAI Service for LLMs.
     - Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation using Azure Cognitive Search combined with Azure OpenAI Service for contextual and accurate responses.
